                    I came to a point where I wanted more. A more challenging area which forces me to think outside
		    the box, and learn more about computer networks. This where I started my Cybersecurity journey.
		    This is the reason why I created this blog. Some of the important skills I have acquired are being
		    able to know how programs worked on lowest level and manipulate them to extract information, how to
		    find vulnerability on target system, gain accesss and pivot across the network to escalate privileges.
		    This area is very different from what I was used to. This involves a lot of research, keen attention
		    to detail and excellent understanding of how computer systems work.

                    Having a strong system admin skills, I decided to enter the world of DevOps. During this time,
		    I worked with cutting edge technologies such as kubernetes, docker, ansible, google cloud, and
		    Gitlab. These are just few, there are too many to mention. What I really enjoy in this role is
		    the automation part - just create a script, run it in the background and you are done for the day.
		    Pretty cool huh? Kidding aside, most of my projects involves setting up repeatable environments,
		    orchestrating and running applications on containers, and providing end to end CICD pipelines for
		    developers to consume. The companies I worked for are online gaming and e-commerce sites in the
		    Philippines and Singapore.

                    I started my career in the Philippines where I was born. My background was a Linux Admin. This
		    was a blessing in disguise because at first I was really looking for a networking job. But
		    unfortunately, the only open job on the company I was applying for is a Junior Linux Admin.
		    Aside from enjoying the terminal for several years, I also got a chance to be a Senior Storage and
		    Backup Engineer for a US client. During that time, I oversaw the whole storage infrastructure
		    and delivered critical datacenter migration projects.
